BuildJS Tool Suite Documentation
================================

The BuildJS Tool Suite has been created to provide a best-of-breed solution for building JS-centric web applications and libraries.  While a large number of build tools already exist in the JS/web space, the BuildJS strive to have a point of difference through the :ref:`speed <design_goals_speed>` of the tools.

Additionally, whereas most of the other tools are designed as larger applications, the BuildJS suite are designed with reusability in mind.  There are a number of smaller :ref:`modules <modules>` that can be used individually, but come together in a single, convenient tool, :ref:`interleave`.

BuildJS is a suite of `Node.js`_ libraries and command-line tools that can be used together to create a sophisticated and efficient build process for your JS application or library.
