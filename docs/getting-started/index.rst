Getting Started
===============

To get started with BuildJS, you have two choices.  You can either install the tools on your local machine and start writing builds now, or :ref:`try it online <buildjs_online>`.  This getting started guide focuses on working on your local machine as that is likely to be the most common use case.

Installation
============

To install the BuildJS tools locally, you will need to have `Node.js`_ running on your machine.  If you don't already have node running, then head over to the `Node.js`_ site and work through the installation process.

If you do have node installed, then let's start by installing :ref:`interleave`::

	npm install -g interleave

**NOTE**: On \*nix/macos systems you may need to run the above with ``sudo``.

To check that interleave is in fact installed, let's just ask it for it's version::

	interleave --version

If everything is working fine, you will see the current version of Interleave installed, if not feel free to head over the `mailing list`_ and ask for some help.
