Installation
============

To install the BuildJS tools locally, you will need to have `Node.js`_ running on your machine.  If you don't already have node running, then head over to the `Node.js`_ site and work through the installation process.

If you do have node installed, then let's start by installing :ref:`interleave`::

	npm install -g interleave

**NOTE**: On \*nix/macos systems you may need to run the above with ``sudo``.

To check that interleave is in fact installed, let's just ask it for it's version::

	interleave --version

If everything is working fine, you will see the current version of Interleave installed, if not feel free to head over the `mailing list`_ and ask for some help.
