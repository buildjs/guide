Interleave

If BuildJS was a band, then Interleave would be the frontman.  It's likely to be the only tool that you actually need to install, as other parts of the suite will wired in as needed.

.. admonition:: Installation

	If you are working with Interleave for standalone command line usage, then it is recommended that you install it globally using the ``-g`` option::

		npm install -g interleave

	In cases where you are working with Interleave for a more complicated build and are bringing in friends such as :ref:`jake` to help out, then you should probably include it in a package.json ``devDependencies`` section instead.
